**Autoencoders**  
Implementing an Autoencoder using tensorflow ad its API.    

Data compression is a big topic thatâ€™s used in computer vision, computer networks, computer architecture, and many other fields. The point of data compression is to convert our input into a smaller representation that we recreate, to a degree of quality. This smaller representation is what would be passed around, and, when anyone needed the original, they would reconstruct it from the smaller representation.  
Many techniques in the past have been hard-coded or use clever algorithms. Autoencoders are unsupervised neural networks that use machine learning to do this compression for us. There are many different kinds of autoencoders like Deep Autoencoder, Sparse Autoencoder, Convolutional Autoencoder.
